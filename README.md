# semantic-web-project (School project)

## Objectives
The main objectives of the project are :
	<ul>
	<li>setup a triplestore</li>
	</ul>
	<li>define a model for the data stored in the triplestore (that is, an ontology)</li>
	<li>populate the triplestore with data: generate them automatically from existing data sources (especially, open data) and/or complement them with manually created data </li>
	<li>setup a web site that will provide a front end for the data </li>
	<li>some pages of the web site must show groups of entities (as a list, a table, or on a map), some must show information about a single entity --> the data shown must be extracted, at least in part, using SPARQL</li>
	<li>add structured data to the web pages, using RDFa or JSON-LD --> the structured data must be a subset of the data in the triplestore </li>
